write a blog on the difference between document and window object in JavaScript

Window:

>The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.

>This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerHeight, name, open, close, moveTo, resize etc.

>Window is the global object.

The document:

>The document object is your html, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser.

>The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie and all properties related to DOM.
